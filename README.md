# Red Light Violation Detection System

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Red Light Violation Detection System, developed as part of my thesis project.

## Code

The implementation code is located in the "code" folder.

## Video Data

This repository includes a variety of video data used for testing the different components of the system, organized as follows:

- **Traffic Lights**: Videos used to test the traffic light detection system are stored in the "Traffic Lights" folder.
- **Vehicles Moving**: Videos used for testing the vehicle detection system can be found in the "Vehicles Moving" folder.
- **Violations**: Videos used for testing the vehicle detection system can also be found in the "Violations" folder.
- **Both**: Edited videos encompassing both a full traffic light cycle and a red-light violation, used to test the entire program are available in the "Both" folder.

Feel free to explore the code and data to understand the implementation and its performance. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for visiting this repository!
